# 4280-P0
Project 0 for Program Translation - CS4280. 

This project deals with taking input from a file stream, and storing the words into a binary search tree. Then I traverse the tree with 3
traversal methods, and output the results to 3 different output files. 

make - builds the project

make <clean> - cleans up project (deletes executable, object, and output files)

./P0 <input file>(optional) - run the file

Project was created with .input1 extension in mind, so if you provide a file, must have .input1 extension. Extension is appended in code
so if you were to be testing with test.input1 file, you would run ./P0 (test) 

For more information, please see programming specification.
